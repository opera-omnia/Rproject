# R is powerful satistical programing langauge. 
# Class notes - Johns Hopkins - R-programming - Prof. R.Peng

# everything in R is an object. 5 basic classes of object. 
# math on Numeric(real number) on interger Objects
2 + 2
3*4
sqrt(8)
2.343 + 2.123

# logical objects
2 == 2
3 == 4
5 > 9

# character objects
"apple"
"apple" == "apples"
"ball" > "apple"

#VECTOR
#basic object in R is a vector - collection of objects of same class. exception is list. 

I_am_Vector <- c(1,2,3)

# c - concatanate - combine
# <- is an assignment operator.

#NUMBERS
#in R are treated as numeric objects - i.e. double precision real numbers. 
# if you enter 1 this is numeric, 1L gives you integer


I_am_Numeric <- 1
# class() to find out class of R object
class(I_am_Numeric)

 I_am_Integer <- 1L
class(I_am_Integer)

#ATTRIBUTES
# object in R can have attributes
# names, dimnames, class, length, dimension
# access using attributes()
